        "\n",
        "In probability theory, the outcome of an experiment may not always be a number. For example, when tossing a coin, the outcomes are Head or Tail. A random variable helps us convert these outcomes into numbers so that we can apply mathematical and probability rules.\n",

        "Question 6: What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental result in statistics which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution, provided the samples are independent and randomly selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Statement of the Central Limit Theorem\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
        "\n",
        "If random samples of size n are taken from any population with finite mean (μ) and finite variance (σ²),\n",
        "\n",
        "then the distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as n increases (usually n ≥ 30).\n",

        "\n",
        "The mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the population mean (μ)\n",
        "\n",

        "Importance of the Central Limit Theorem\n",
        "\n",
        "The Central Limit Theorem is critical in statistics because:\n",
        "\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "If we take large samples of customer waiting times (which may not be normally distributed), the average waiting time will still follow a normal distribution due to the CLT.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 7: What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: A confidence interval is a range of values that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter, such as the mean or proportion, based on sample data. It shows how accurate and reliable a sample estimate is.\n",
        "\n",
        "A confidence interval is usually associated with a confidence level, such as 90%, 95%, or 99%, which indicates how confident we are that the true population value lies within the given range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning of Confidence Interval\n",
        "\n",
        "If we construct a 95% confidence interval, it means that if we take many samples and build intervals in the same way, about 95% of those intervals will contain the true population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Confidence Intervals\n",
        "\n",
        "Provides a range rather than a single value estimate\n",
        "\n",
        "Indicates the precision of the estimate\n",
        "\n",
        "Depends on sample size and variability\n",
        "\n",
        "Higher confidence level gives a wider interval\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on probability theory and sampling distributions\n",
        "\n",
        "Significance of Confidence Intervals\n",
        "\n",
        "Confidence intervals are important in statistical analysis because:\n",
        "\n",
        "They show the reliability of sample results\n",
        "\n",
        "They help in decision-making and interpretation of data\n",
        "\n",
        "They are more informative than point estimates\n",
        "\n",
        "They are widely used in hypothesis testing\n",
        "\n",
        "They are used in research, surveys, medical studies, and quality control\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "If the average score of a sample is 70 and the 95% confidence interval is (65, 75), it suggests that the true population mean is likely to lie between 65 and 75.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 8: What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:The expected value of a probability distribution is the average value that a random variable is expected to take over a large number of trials. It represents the long-term mean of the outcomes of a random experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Expected value is also known as the mathematical expectation and is denoted by E(X).\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning of Expected Value\n",
        "\n",
        "The expected value does not always represent an actual outcome. Instead, it shows the center or balance point of a probability distribution and helps predict results in the long run.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in a game of chance, the expected value tells us whether the game is fair, profitable, or a loss over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importance of Expected Value\n",
        "\n",
        "Expected value is important because:\n",
        "\n",
        "It summarizes the entire probability distribution in one number\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used in decision-making under uncertainty\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps compare different random experiments\n",
        "\n",
        "It is widely used in economics, finance, insurance, and gambling\n",
        "\n",
        "It forms the basis for variance and standard deviation\n",
        "\n",
        "Example\n",
        "\n",

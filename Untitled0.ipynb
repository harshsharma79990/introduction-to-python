What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","- OOP is a way of programming where we organize code into objects (things) instead of just functions.\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n","- A class is like a blueprint. Example: “Car” is a class.\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n","- An object is a real thing made from a class.\n","4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n","- Abstraction → Hiding details, only showing what is needed.\n","- Encapsulation → Wrapping data and methods inside one unit.\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","- Dunder methods are special methods with double underscores like __init__, __str__. They are built-in functions in Python.\n","6. Explain inheritance in OOP?\n","- Inheritance means one class can take features of another class. Example: A “Dog” class can inherit from an “Animal” class.\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","- Polymorphism means “one thing, many forms.” Example: The method speak() can make a dog bark and a cat meow.\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","- By using classes and making some variables private (using _ or __ before names). This hides data from outside.\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","- A constructor is a special method (__init__) that runs automatically when you make an object. Example: When you create Car(), the constructor sets the color, speed etc.\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","- Class method → Works with the class itself, not just objects.\n","- Static method → A normal function inside a class that doesn't depend on the class or object.\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","- Python doesn't support real method overloading, but we can make a methods that act differently based on how many or what type of inputs it gets.\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","- When a child class changes a method from the parent class. Example: Both Dog and Cat have a speak() method, but each does it differently.\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","- Because it makes code flexible. You can write one method name like draw() and use it for circles, squares, triangles.\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","- It's a class that cannot be used directly. It only provides a design for other classes.\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","- Code is organized.\n","- Easy to reuse.\n","- Easy to maintain.\n","- Real-world modeling.\n","\n","17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","- When a class inherits from more than one parent class.\n","18. Difference between class variable and instance variable\n","- Class variable → Shared by all objects.\n","- Instance variable → Different for each object.\n","\n","19. Purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods?\n","- __str__ → Returns a user-friendly string (nice output).\n","- __repr__ → Returns a developer-friendly string (debugging).\n","\n","20. Significance of super() function in Python?\n","- Super() lets a child class call methods from its parent class. Example: Dog can call Animal's constructor.\n","\n","21. Significance of __del__ method in Python?\n","- __del__ is called when an object is deleted. Example: It can clean up memory or close files.\n","\n","22. Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?\n","\n","- @staticmethod → Does not use class or object, just a function inside class.\n","\n","- @classmethod → Works with the class itself and takes cls as input.\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","- When a parent class method is redefined in child classes, Python calls the correct one depending on the object."],"metadata":{"id":"dokYHLsK60XS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# OOPS PRACTICAL QUESTIONS\n","#1.
